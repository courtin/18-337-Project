    "The thing that takes the most time with this algorithm is checking the solution is optimal after the initial assignment of all variables.  When the first integer variable assignment is made, all subsequent decision variables are still free to be non-integer.  However, once all subsequent variables are given an integer value the optimal choice for the first value may be different; so this algoirthm goes back and checks the optimal integer assignment variables under the constraint that all other variables are constrained.  This is done iteratively, by relaxing each variable succesively and picking the new integer optimum until no changes need to be made. If this process isn't completed, the solution doesn't change much (the total cost almost not at all) and the algorithm speeds up considerably."

    "Future work: There are two main areas of continued development on this project that I plan to continue over the next several months.  The first is in increasing the fidelity, accuracy, and complexity of the underlying aircraft model.  A third type of motor (rotating to provide lift and thrust) will be added; but currently that seems to require a more complex, and slower, formulation of the problem.  It's also purely in Python so I focused less on that for this project.  The other area of improvement is working on how to handle binary decision variables, which may or may not have logical implications for other decision variables.  For example, we would like to say that our vehicle must have an integer number of wings or rotors but must have one or the other.  This can be done using the continuous integer formulation developed here if combinations of the two are admissable (the vehicle can have wings and rotors), but if they are exlusionary constraints (wings or rotors but not both) then there needs to be an additional level of logic. It's not yet clear if that's useful capability in solving this problem, or how precisely that would be implemented. "
